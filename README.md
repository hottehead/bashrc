A modular bashrc  configuration
======

A modular bashrc with install script.

## How to install?
Installation is simple. Checkout repository to folder "~/.bash_runtime" and run the script. The script will add one line to your ~/.profile file.


	git clone git://github.com/hottehead/bashrc.git ~/.bash_runtime
	sh ~/.bash_runtime/install_bashrc.sh


## Special commands
A few features require packages installed via a package manager like backports or homebrew. You will see these commands but they will fail but do no harm. You can comment them in the file (they are marked) or install the appropriate package if you want to.
